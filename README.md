Paste following line into Additional Include Directiories

$(SolutionDir)/../ExternalLibs/GLFW/include;$(SolutionDir)/../ExternalLibs/GLEW/include;$(SolutionDir)/../ExternalLibs/GLM;$(SolutionDir)/../ExternalLibs/GLUT;%(AdditionalIncludeDirectories)

Than you need to import glut into your system by using Setup/glut-3.7.6-bin.zip. 

glut.h: 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include\GL\'
glut32.lib: 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\lib\'
glut32.dll: 'C:\Windows\System32\'
